# Slugrace

Slugrace is a 2D racing and betting game, created in .NET MAUI. I have a series of posts on my Prospero Coder blog where I demonstrate how I use .NET MAUI (which I'm learning myself as I go along) and how I build the app from Scratch. You will find the first part of the series here: https://prosperocoder.com/maui/basics-of-net-maui-part-1-introduction-to-net-maui/
